This repository features code and figures for the manuscript on "Assessing the drift of Fish Aggregating Devices in the tropical Pacific Ocean".

The 'Code' folder features several python codes ran with the module parcels (for more information, see https://oceanparcels.org/).

This consists of 3 codes:
- WTPO_d50_FAD.py - A virtual dFAD simulation with depth averaged currents (from MOi dataset)
- WTPO_d0_FAD.py  - A virtual particle simulation with only surface currents (from MOi dataset)
- AnalysisAndVisualisation.ipynb - analysis on data generated from previous scripts and plotting of figures

The 'Figures' folder features the figures from the manuscript (and several more) in pdf format.
